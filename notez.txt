Git  Notes

To change from ec2 to root
# sudo su -

# yum update   ; to check the any updates available in current instance

# yum install git ; is used to install git in current ec2 instance

#git --version    ; is used to check git version

#git -v ; also same to check git version

#ssh-keygen ; to generate key 

#git checkout -b <branch_name> ;to create branch and switch to that new branch

#git checkout <branch_name>  ; to swirch from one branch to another

#git branch ; to check current working branch and list of branchs

#git push –set-upstream origin <branch_name>
	to make connection between from local branch to remote branch we can use this cmd

 #git push -u <origin> <branch_name>
	same as above set upstram

#git push -u <origin> <loacl_branch_name>: <remote_branch_name>	
	One done just use git pull

#git remote  ; which shows the remote entaties which available ./git/config

#git remote -v

# git remote add <name> <url> ; the name should be any name  and url must be the 
remote repositery url

#git remote rm <name> : remove the entity name

#git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>

#git push <remote name>

#git push <remote_name>  --force
#git remote set-url origin<remote name> <url> ; to update 

#git switch -c <new_branch_name>

#git push -u <origin> <local_branch>:<remote_branch>

#git branch --vv  : to check which branch to link from local to remote

Q1 : how to get one branch file into another branch
	using merge if anothe repo need to pull

Q2 : what is the use of origin
	origin is a alise name for remote repo url

Q3: what is set upstream origin
	there are two ways to create upstream 
	#git push –set-upstream <origin> <branch_name> # will make  a link to current local branch to remote branch if remote dont have branch it will create and make a link
	                               or
	#git push -u <origin> <branch_name>
   here -u flag used for to create link between local banch to remote branch
 

Q4: check once git clone done : git remote -v
         	Checked it default set origin which remote repositery name.
